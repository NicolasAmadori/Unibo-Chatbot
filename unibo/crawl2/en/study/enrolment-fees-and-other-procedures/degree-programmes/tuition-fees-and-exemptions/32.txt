FAQs - frequently asked questions: tuition fees
-----------------------------------------------

*   Why do I have to pay €157.04 even though I have full exemption?
    
    This figure corresponds to:
    
    *   the €140 regional tax for the right to education
    *   stamp duty of €16
    *   insurance premium of €1.04
    
    The amount is not a university fee, so you have to pay it regardless of your economic situation, even if you are fully exempt.
