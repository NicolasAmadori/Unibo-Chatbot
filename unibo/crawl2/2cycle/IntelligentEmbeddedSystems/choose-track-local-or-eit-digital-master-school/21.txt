The first year at the University of Bologna aims at offering a full understanding of the most recent trends in software engineering for embedded systems, including example of applications. The second year may be chosen to be more software or hardware-oriented and offers a specialisation and a graduation project. The graduation project includes an internship at a company or a research institute and results in a Master thesis with a strong innovation and entrepreneurship dimension.  
Part of the curriculum is the EIT Digital Summer School, a two-week programmes held at several locations in Europe, in relation to five areas with major societal and industrial challenges and business opportunities: Digital Cities, Digital Industry, Digital Wellbeing, Digital Tech, and Digital Finance.   
The EIT Digital Master School enables the students to engage with academic, research and industrial partners across Europe.
