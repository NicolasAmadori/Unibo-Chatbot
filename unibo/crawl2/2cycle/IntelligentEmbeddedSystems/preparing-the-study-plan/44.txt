The study plan is composed of all the exams that students have to pass in order to graduate. Some are compulsory activities, while others can be chosen and are electives.

Students can take exams only for teaching activities that have already been included in their study plan.

### When can I submit / modify my study plan?

You can sumbit/change your study plan in two periods during the academic year. For the academic year 2023/24 the periods will be:

First period: from the 7th of October to the 10th of November 2024

Second period: from the 10th of February to the 7th of March 2025

Students can modify their study plan **only** in these periods.

How can I submit / modify the study plan?
-----------------------------------------

You can submit your study plan if you are duly enrolled  in the programme and have paid the tuition fees. If you are a non-EU international student, you must also hold a valid Residence Permit.

To sumbit/change your study plan, you need to access **[Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/)** with your University username and password and select the activities you are interested in, then click on “save”.

If you are a part-time student or if you want to choose an activity from a degree programme with restricted access, you have to fill in  a paper form which will be available on this page and you have to send it to the Student Administration Office at [segcesena@unibo.it](mailto:segcesena@unibo.it) , within the deadlines stated above.

Also in case you wish to choose a learning activity from a Bachelor's Degree, you have to fill in the paper form, and the choice will have to be approved by the Degree Programme Board.

The form will have to be sent to  the Student Administration Office at [segcesena@unibo.it](mailto:segcesena@unibo.it) , attaching also a letter explaining the reasons for the choice.
