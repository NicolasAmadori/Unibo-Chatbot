Students enrolled in the Intelligent Embedded Systems track in partnership with EIT Digital Master School will attend the first year in the University of Bologna and the second year in one of the other partner Universities abroad.

The final examination will be prepared during the second year abroad and will be based on the internship that is going to be attended in the second year.

The final examination consists in writing a dissertation on a subject that is relevanto to your studies, elaborated in an original way, under the guidance of a supervisor. The dissertation will be discussed publicly during a specific final examination session which will be held in front of a Board.  
The Board will assess your performance using your curriculum as a reference. During the dissertation discussion, you may use slides and the Board may ask you in-depth questions on methods, results and any developments about your work.
