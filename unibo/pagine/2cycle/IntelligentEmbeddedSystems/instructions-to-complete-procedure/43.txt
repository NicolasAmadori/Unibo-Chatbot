Once you have completed your application for matriculation and paid the tuition fees, you will find further information on [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/sol/welcome.htm?siteLanguage=en) on how to validate your digital identity, activate your career and obtain your [badge](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/enrolment-transfer-and-final-examination/the-badge-for-first-cycle-single-cycle-degree-and-second-cycle-degree-students-1).

The instructions you may receive, according to your profile, are given below.

Digital identity
----------------

### What does it mean?

Validating your digital identity means associating your name.surname@studio.unibo.it account with the information you provided during the matriculation process.

### What do I need to do?

Your digital identity will be automatically validated, without you having to do anything, if one of the following cases applies:

*   you hold [SPID](https://www.spid.gov.it/) credentials and have used them to access [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/sol/welcome.htm?siteLanguage=en) at least once;
*   you have an electronic identity card and access [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/sol/welcome.htm?siteLanguage=en) via the pathway Log in with [CIE](https://idp.unibo.it/adfs/ls/?SAMLRequest=fVLLbsIwELz3KyLf8zKEh0WCKAgViaoIQg%2B9IMd2ilXHTrMOav%2B%2BSQBRLki%2B2JqZnZ3xZPpTKOckKpBGxyj0AuQIzQyX%2BjNG%2B3TpjtA0eZoALRQuyay2R70V37UA68wARGUb3txoqAtR7UR1kkzst%2BsYHa0tgfg%2B2JoLbaVXa5kZT1ofjPIpz%2BHAqFIZZV9TpmQDOWhaiHg3e13jefeAnEUzRmpqO29XRcnLm1gr5CvwkbM0FROdvxjlVIFAzmoRowMOwnHOIyqiaNQPwyDrUTFig2w8yPJ8yPkwH494iBs0bCiAPIkbH6AWKw2WahsjHOCeG%2FRdPEjDHomaM%2FD64fADOZvKWMOMepb6nFtdaWIoSCDtTkAsI%2B1eBHsByc4gIC9punE3b7sUOe%2FX%2FHGbf9OIBnJO%2FLFWeRmMknNBpHNctVkU1D7mti%2BSu3kHJW1F9vdu9mM6vZaPkodVT%2Fz%2FzpLL9f4nJX8%3D&RelayState=%3FspidL%3D1%26spidACS%3D0);
*   you have already been part of the student community at the University of Bologna from 2004 onwards;
*   you took a written or oral exam, also remotely, at the University of Bologna (not including TOLC tests and national competitive exams).

If you do not meet any of the above conditions and cannot have SPID credentials because you are resident abroad, contact the Student Administration Office of your degree programme or, if you are resident abroad and you hold a qualification obtained abroad, the International Student Administration Office in Bologna or on Campus.

Career activation and badge
---------------------------

### What does it mean?

By activating your career, you will be able to use services, such as accessing the Wi-Fi network and online library resources, and carry out activities: booking exams, filling in your study plan, changing degree programme, transferring to another university, withdrawing from studies.  
Once your career is activated, you will receive an e-mail with instructions on how to obtain your badge.

**Your career must be activated by 28 February 2025.**
