Students enrolled in the Intelligent Embedded Systems track in partnership with EIT Digital Master School will attend the first year in the University of Bologna and the second year in one of the other partner Universities abroad.

The final examination will be prepared during the second year abroad and will be based on the internship that is going to be attended in the second year.

The final examination consists in writing a dissertation on a subject that is relevanto to your studies, elaborated in an original way, under the guidance of a supervisor. The dissertation will be discussed publicly during a specific final examination session which will be held in front of a Board.  
The Board will assess your performance using your curriculum as a reference. During the dissertation discussion, you may use slides and the Board may ask you in-depth questions on methods, results and any developments about your work.

Graduation application
----------------------

In order to apply, you must access [Studenti Online](http://www.studenti.unibo.it/) before the deadlines for the 24/25 academic year that will be published as soon as possible.

Admission Requirements
----------------------

In order to graduate, you must have:

*   sat all the exams in your study plan and had them recorded;
*   paid all tuition fees;
*   uploaded the dissertation in pdf format on Studenti Online. When uploading the dissertation, the system will ask you to enter some key words and a brief abstract. The dissertation file can be replaced as many times as the student need, until the requirements deadline expires.
*   filled the Alma Laurea questionnaire on Studenti Online in.

The Student Administration Office will verify all requirements and will contact you if there are any issues, in order to allow you to regularise your position before the final examination.

The graduation application is valid for just one graduation session. If you graduate in a later session, you will have to re-submit your graduation application and pay only the duty stamp ("marca da bollo").

Deadlines
---------

One graduation session is scheduled each year. The session includes a number of dates, each with their deadlines for the submission of the graduation application, requirements and dates.

New dates for the 2024/2025 academic year will be published as soon as possible.
