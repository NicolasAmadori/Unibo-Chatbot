In conformity with the ministerial decree on degree class objectives, the teaching programme aims to give graduates both a solid theoretical, technological and methodological grounding, and some precise operative skills acquired through working on set projects that form an integral part of the training. Guided in this work, students will learn of the problem issues, reference models and the methods typically used in modelling and designing modern systems of data processing, as well as the very latest techniques by which to apply them. Special attention is paid to giving a full context to the main underpinning principles, illustrating methodological approaches, and giving a systems science overview of the offices and instruments that jointly support design of software, operative systems, information systems, calculator networks, web infrastructure and computational architectures. Specific expertise in this area is completed by a solid grounding in physics and mathematics, and interdisciplinary know-how concerning other core subject areas.  
The programme is completed by bringing the level of English up to B1. This may involve both practice in the four language skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking) and compulsory attendance of lessons. The criteria will be announced as the degree programme unfolds, in line with the norms set by the Academic Bodies.  
All in all, the degree programme covers the theoretical and practical skills involved in the main areas of computer science.  
Some specific learning targets regard techniques of ICT system programming and design, as well as familiarity with the main hardware and software technology and network systems. This basic knowledge is then supplemented with more detailed professional knowledge in specific areas of computer science which may form a passport to the world of work. To achieve this learning programme, a basic scientific background must be acquired and a method of scientific study and analysis, enabling the future graduate to gain new knowledge on his/her own, keeping abreast of a changing discipline and using innovative methods and complex apparatus.  
Graduates will possess:  
\- a gamut of knowledge and skills in the various ICT areas of use in designing, developing and managing ICT systems and networks, regardless of the specific applicative domain;  
\- mastery of the mathematical tools needed for formal modelling, analysis, evaluation, design and implementation of systems;  
\- a certain degree of independence in assimilating various cutting-edge topics in the graduates' own field of study  
\- an ability to think up and defend arguments both in a work group and when working on their own;  
\- practice in gathering and interpreting experimental data with which to test the effectiveness and efficiency of information systems;  
\- effective use of written and oral English, as well as Italian, both in the graduates' special field and for exchange of general information;  
\- the ability to do bibliographical research, making use of databanks and information networks;  
\- the skills needed to pursue their studies to the next level with a high degree of autonomy.  
To meet this brief, the degree programme lays on:  
\- training activities designed to teach basic mathematics and the essentials of the main ICT areas (including programming languages, algorithms, operative systems, databases and information systems);  
\- laboratory projects to practise programming methods;  
\- English language teaching and practice.
