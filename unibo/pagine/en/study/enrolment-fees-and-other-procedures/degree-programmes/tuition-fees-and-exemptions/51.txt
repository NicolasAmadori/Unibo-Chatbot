You can pay your fees via the PagoPA system; to monitor the status of your payments, please refer to the 'Fee Situation - Enrolment' section on [Studenti Online](https://studenti.unibo.it/sol/welcome.htm). After 15 November 2023 you will be informed of the amounts of the second and third instalments, if due.

The payment will be valid from the moment you view it on your profile (this may take up to 2 days).

**You have to keep up to date with the amounts and deadlines because the University of Bologna does not send notices.**

I am enrolling in the second year “fuori corso” (past envisaged completion time for the degree programme)

If you are enrolling in degree programme, the minimum fee to be paid is €157.04 while the [maximum varies depending on the programme \[.pdf 103 KB\]](https://www.unibo.it/en/attachments/tasse/ImportiMassimiTasseUnibo2023_24.pdf/@@download/file/ImportiMassimiTasseUnibo2023_24.pdf).  
The fee is composed of:

*   a fixed amount of €157.04 that you have to pay even if you are fully exempt 
*   a variable amount calculated according to the [economic situation of your family (ISEE)](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/enrolment-fees-and-other-procedures/degree-programmes/tuition-fees-and-exemptions/ISEE-and-other-documentation-for-tuition-fee-exemptions)

Enter your ISEE value and the Degree Programme in which you wish to enrol in a [tuition fee simulator](https://studenti.unibo.it/sol/simulatore.htm) to calculate your tuition fees.

### ![Image 10: pin](https://www.unibo.it/it/immagini/pin.png)When and how to pay

To continue studying at university here's what you need to do:

1.  **Submit the necessary documents:** prepare [the necessary documents](https://www.unibo.it/en/study/enrolment-fees-and-other-procedures/degree-programmes/tuition-fees-and-exemptions/ISEE-and-other-documentation-for-tuition-fee-exemptions) in good time in order to obtain full or partial exemption. It may take several weeks to obtain them and the deadline for submission is 30 October 2023 at 18:00 via the online services of [ER.GO - Regional Authority for the Right to Higher Education](https://servizionline.er-go.it/domande2/)[.](https://servizionline.er-go.it/domande2/) You can also submit documents late, from 30 October to 15 November 2023 at 18:00, but you will have to pay a late submission fee of €100. If you do not submit your ISEE by 15 November, or you submit it with missing or incorrect information, you will have to pay the [maximum fees \[.pdf 103 KB\]](https://www.unibo.it/en/attachments/tasse/ImportiMassimiTasseUnibo2023_24.pdf/@@download/file/ImportiMassimiTasseUnibo2023_24.pdf).  
    You can submit your application independently from the enrolment in a degree programme of the University of Bologna. Late submissions will not be accepted, even if the enrolment deadline for the degree programme has not expired yet.
2.  **Proceed with the payment**: if you submit documents, you will pay in instalments. If you do not submit them, you can pay in a single instalment or in instalments.
